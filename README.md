# Obs≈Çuga faktur

A WPF application in which we can quickly generate an invoice through a clear and easy-to-use form. It simplifies the work thanks to the fact that it contains lists of products and customers, whose elements previously created are reusable in the invoice form. In addition, the application allows you to generate an invoice in the form of a pdf file, which we can then send to the recipient of the invoice or print.
